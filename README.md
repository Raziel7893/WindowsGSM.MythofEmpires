- To give yourself and/or others Admin acces add the Steam ID's after -ServerAdminAccounts=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and separate with ";" if there are multiple admins.


# Other Server Settings:
I made a list of all Server Parameters and a Spreadsheet to easaly copy and paste a string to your Server.

Be sure to check the second Tab in the Spreadsheet for the copy&paste output for either WindowsGSM or the ServerStart.bat

You can find all other Server Settings in the "PrivateServerTool" and try around for yourself but it seems that not all Settings work or take affect.
